## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I started using flexbox and CSS grid more while working through this project in order to reach the optimal layout depending on viewers' different device's screen size.

### Continued development

I would like to work more on responsive design in future projects. I am also planning to study about CSS grid in depth.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to thank Bitcamp 101 (Georgia) for amazing lectures, and also, my mentor Paata Gharibashvili who has helped me a lot while working on different projects.
